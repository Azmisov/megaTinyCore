sentence=Enables the communication with devices that use the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus.
paragraph=SPI is a synchronous serial data protocol used by microcontrollers for communicating with one or more peripheral devices quickly over short distances. It uses three lines common to all devices (MISO, MOSI and SCK) and one specific for each device. This version has been enhanced to support the new attachInterrupt implementation if selected, and correct a nasty bug that would unset SSD (Slave Select Disable) whenever beginTransaction was used; now it will not, provided you use the included constants
